# AlgorithmScratchpad

I developed this library to assist in testing the efficiency of algorithms.

This library features an easy to use decorator that can generate test data for testing an algorithm then return a report about the time complexity.

Algorighm Scratchpad also provides a 'scratchpad' class that can be used for writing and testing algorithms that require complex data structures such as linked lists, binary trees and custom structures.

Lastly, this library can be used to compare the efficiency of multiple algorithms producing a report about run times and time complexity.

You can read more about what Algorithm Scratchpad can do and how it came about at my [portfolio](http://www.leeloftiss.com/view_project/2).

Algorithm Scratchpad requires the [exrex](https://github.com/asciimoo/exrex) library.
